        <div class="par1"><p>
            <span>Build Real Experience Early:</span> <br> Start with internships, volunteering, freelancing, or part-time jobs—even unpaid ones at first. 
            Any experience shows effort and builds skills. <br><br>
            <span>Learn In-Demand Skills:</span> <br> Focus on skills employers are looking for like communication, 
            teamwork, critical thinking, and tech tools (Excel, Canva, AI, coding, etc.). Free platforms like Coursera, LinkedIn Learning, and YouTube can help. <br><br>
            <span>Work on Soft Skills:</span> <br> Practice showing up on time, solving problems, and speaking professionally. <br><br>
            <span>Network More:</span> <br>Talk to people in industries you like. Go to events, message professionals online, or ask for advice. Connections often lead to job chances. <br> <br>
            <span>Create a Strong CV & Cover Letter:</span> <br>Make sure your CV is clear, updated, and focused on your strengths. Use a short, personalized cover letter for each job to show you care. <br>
