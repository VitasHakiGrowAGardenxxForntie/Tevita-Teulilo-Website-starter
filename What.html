            <div class="par1"><p>The Gen Z employment crisis means that many young people
                 (born around 1997–2012) are having a hard time finding good jobs. Even though a lot of them have
                  finished school or university, they are still unemployed or working in low-paying jobs that don’t match their skills.
                <br>and in New Zealand: <br><span>These are some of the worst youth employment rates ever!</span></p></div>

            <div class="par2"><p>According to the statistics from Stats NZ and The Press (stuff.co.nz), the unemployment rate for Gen Z has risen sharply—by nearly 6% over the past three years. This increase shows a worrying trend for young people entering the workforce. What’s even more concerning is that Gen Z’s unemployment rate is now more than three times higher than the national average. While the overall job market may seem steady for older generations, many young people are still struggling to find stable work or even get hired at all. These numbers highlight a serious employment crisis for Gen Z, showing that they are being left behind despite being the most educated and digitally skilled generation to date.</p></div>
