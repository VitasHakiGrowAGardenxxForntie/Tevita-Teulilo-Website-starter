        <div class="Text1"><p>Carrying on from the video: The situation leaves a lot of Gen Z feeling frustrated,
             anxious, and unsure about their future. They work hard but still struggle to afford basic needs like rent,
              food, or transport. On social media, many talk about being burnt out and feeling stuck,
              even while doing everything "right." The Gen Z employment crisis isn’t just about finding any job — it’s
               about how hard it is to build a stable life in today’s economy. If nothing changes, more young people will continue to
                feel left behind, making this crisis even more serious for the future 
            and that is why I made this website. To identify and help prevent the unemployment rates from increasing.
