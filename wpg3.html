                <span>Automation and AI replacing entry-level jobs:</span> <br>Many simple and routine roles that young workers used to start with are now being automated, <br> leaving fewer opportunities for Gen Z to get their first job.
                </li><br>
                <li><span>Higher job requirements from employers:</span> <br>Employers often expect candidates to already have skills and experience, <br> even for entry-level positions, which makes it harder for Gen Z to get started.</li><br>
                <li><span>Economic uncertainty and high living costs</span> <br>Rising rent, food prices, and unstable job markets make it harder for Gen Z to find and keep stable employment.</li><br><br>
                <li><span>Mismatch between education and job market needs</span> <br>Rising rent, food prices, and unstable job markets make it harder for Gen Z to find and keep stable employment.</li><br><br>
