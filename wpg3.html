            <ul>
                <li>
                    <span>Automation and AI replacing entry-level jobs:</span><br>
                    Many simple and routine roles that young workers used to start with are now being automated, leaving fewer opportunities for Gen Z to get their first job.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>Higher job requirements from employers:</span><br>
                    Employers often expect candidates to already have skills and experience, even for entry-level positions, which makes it harder for Gen Z to get started.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>Economic uncertainty and high living costs:</span><br>
                    Rising rent, food prices, and unstable job markets make it harder for Gen Z to find and keep stable employment.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>Mismatch between education and job market needs:</span><br>
                    Many Gen Z graduates find that what they studied doesn’t match what employers are actually looking for.
